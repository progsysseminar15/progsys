I know nothing about hardware, so this paper was somewhat foreign to me in parts. I find their idea of physiological time very useful and reminiscent of many other things we have discussed, though with a more tight linking to physical time--which seems to make sense to me, since these clocks are closer to the physical world than some of the other clocks we've discussed in the course. The notion of "traveling forward" in time seems reminiscent of some other things we've discussed as well, where it's fine to write wherever you like as long as there hasn't already been a read after that. 

Some questions I am left with: Knowing nothing about hardware, will this be difficult to implement? It doesn't seem any more difficult than the directory coherence, but there may be things I am missing. How accurate are simulations -> will this actually perform well in practice? Since you take a lease on cachelines, and have to write into the future, doesn't this mean that other cores may get stale data (w.r.t. to phyical time)

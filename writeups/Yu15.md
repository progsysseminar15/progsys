I know nothing about hardware, so this paper was somewhat foreign to me in parts. I find their idea of physiological time very useful and reminiscent of many other things we have discussed, though with a more tight linking to physical time--which seems to make sense to me, since these clocks are closer to the physical world than some of the other clocks we've discussed in the course. The notion of "traveling forward" in time seems reminiscent of some other things we've discussed as well, where it's fine to write wherever you like as long as there hasn't already been a read after that. 

Some questions I am left with: Knowing nothing about hardware, will this be difficult to implement? It doesn't seem any more difficult than the directory coherence, but there may be things I am missing. How accurate are simulations -> will this actually perform well in practice? Since you take a lease on cachelines, and have to write into the future, doesn't this mean that other cores may get stale data (w.r.t. to phyical time)

This paper presents Tardis, a new memory coherence protocol that uses timestamp counters to order memory operations and enforce sequential consistency in shared memory system. The motivation is that today’s widely-adopted directory based coherence protocols have latency and scalability issues. Specifically, the delay incurred by waiting for the acknowledgement message of invalidation requests raises performance concerns, and storing the sharer information or supporting broadcast won’t scale. Tardis can directly express the memory consistency model by enforcing the global memory order with timestamp counters without using a globally synchronized clock. Furthermore, it only requires O(logN) instead of O(N) storage per cache block where N denotes the number of cores. The authors argue that Tardis is simpler to understand, implement, and has better scalability over directory based coherence protocols.

The comparison between Lamport clocks and their physiological (a combination of physical time and logical timestamp order) clock is interesting. Basically, the main difference is that if the order is implicit in physical time, the physiological timestamp is not incremented. Another thing to note is that although Tardis offers better performance and scalability during the invalidation and eviction phase, it might incur more overhead during data renewal due to the possibility of expired cacheline. Therefore the effectiveness of this protocol might be workload dependent.
